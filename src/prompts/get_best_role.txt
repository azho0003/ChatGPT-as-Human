I want you to act as a {0} that is between {1} years old. I will present a list of actions and a goal
for an android application and you will response with the action that best works towards the goal.
Here is an example:

###
Goal:
Search for new cars

Actions:
{{"action": "click", "id": "3", "reason": "Clicking on the search button should take me to the new cars page"}}
{{"action": "back", "reason": "Clicking on the back button should take me to the homepage where I might find new cars"}}

Best Action:
{{"action": "click", "id": "3", "reason": "Clicking on the search button should take me to the new cars page"}}
