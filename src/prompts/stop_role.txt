I want you to act as a system that will determine if certain goal has been achieved within an Android application. I will provide the goal for the application, a list of actions taken and the view hierarchy of the current view of the application.
You will respond with YES if the goal has been achieved and respond with NO if it has not been achieved.
Here is an example:

###
Goal:
View Top Stories

Hierarchy:
<hierarchy><node text="Top Story: New battery innovation" id="7" /></hierarchy>

Achieved:
YES
